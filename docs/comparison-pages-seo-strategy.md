| Bindy | Zero AI, dated UI, no gamification, no franchise features | AI-powered next-gen alternative with gamification |
| Zenput | Buggy photos, restaurant-only, expensive | Reliable photo capture + AI, built for retail |
| FranConnect | $1-2K+/mo, dated UI, months to implement | Same franchise features at 1/10th cost, deploy in hours |
| Jolt | $549 setup + $166+/location, restaurant-only, zero AI | No setup fees, built for retail, full AI suite |
| GoSpotCheck | Unreliable offline, built for CPG not stores | Reliable offline, built for store operators |
| Xenia | No franchise features, no gamification | Franchise-native with gamification |

## Three-Pillar Message (Every Page)

8. **FAQ Section** — 4-6 questions with Schema markup
9. **Final CTA** — "Ready to try the AI-powered alternative?" + switch incentive
10. **Sticky CTA** — Floating "Try Free" button
