## Competitor Deep Dives

### 1. Zenput / Crunchtime

Zenput was acquired by CrunchTime in 2022 and is now the "Operations Execution" module within the Crunchtime suite. Used in 60,000+ locations across 100+ countries, primarily in foodservice and multi-unit retail.

| Attribute | Details |
|---|---|
| **Free Trial** | Listed as available on review sites, but primary website CTA is "Schedule a Demo" |
| **Trial Length** | Not publicly specified |
| **Signup Flow** | Demo-gated. Form at zenput.com/demo or phone call |
| **Credit Card Required** | N/A -- no self-serve signup |
| **Product Tour / Interactive Demo** | None visible on marketing site |
| **Conversion CTAs** | "Schedule a Demo" only. No visible pricing page |
| **Pricing Visibility** | Hidden. Tiered model (Essential, Premium, Advanced, Brand-wide) estimated at $7-10/user/month |
| **Chat Widget** | AI chatbot inside the product only; no marketing-site chat |
| **Incentives** | None publicly visible |

**Key Takeaway:** Fully sales-led. Targets enterprise multi-unit operators. No self-serve path exists.

### 2. GoSpotCheck (now FORM)

Field execution management platform with image recognition, task management, and Looker-powered analytics. Requires a 20-user minimum.

| Attribute | Details |
|---|---|
| **Free Trial** | Official stance: trials/POCs require internal approvals, tied to specific use cases |
| **Trial Length** | Custom, negotiated during sales process |
| **Signup Flow** | Demo-gated. "Schedule a Demo" at gospotcheck.com |
| **Credit Card Required** | N/A |
| **Product Tour / Interactive Demo** | **Yes** -- interactive clickthrough tours at form.com/product-tour/gospotcheck-by-form/ |
| **Conversion CTAs** | "Schedule a Demo" primary; "Take the Tour" secondary |
| **Pricing Visibility** | Partially visible. Essentials at $8,400/year (20 users); $35/user/month additional. Three tiers |
| **Chat Widget** | Not prominently visible |
| **Incentives** | None publicly visible |

**Key Takeaway:** Stands out with their interactive product tour -- the most sophisticated marketing-site experience in the competitive set. Actual signup remains sales-gated.

---

### 3. MeazureUp

Digital audit apps for restaurant, retail, and hospitality (now part of Ladle). Multi-location brand standards focus.

| Attribute | Details |
|---|---|
| **Free Trial** | Yes -- "Try MeazureUp Free" prominently featured, plus customized pilot |
| **Trial Length** | Open-ended pilot: "use AuditApp for as long as you need" |
| **Signup Flow** | Hybrid. Free trial page exists but process starts with executive team meeting |
| **Credit Card Required** | No |
| **Product Tour / Interactive Demo** | Not visible on marketing site |
| **Conversion CTAs** | Dual: "Try MeazureUp Free" and "Schedule a Demo" |
| **Pricing Visibility** | Hidden. Custom pricing for AuditApp and DailyChex products |
| **Chat Widget** | Not prominently visible |
| **Incentives** | Extended/open-ended pilot period |

**Key Takeaway:** Open-ended pilot removes trial anxiety but requiring executive meetings creates friction. Dual CTA approach is worth noting.

| Attribute | Details |
|---|---|

| **Chat Widget** | Not confirmed |
| **Incentives** | Volume discounts. One-time implementation fee (~$500-600) |

**Key Takeaway:** One of the few with visible pricing, building trust. But no trial or demo tour is a missed opportunity.

### 5. Compliant IA (now Bindy)

Rebranded from Compliant IA. Cloud audit, task management, and communication for retail and hospitality. Serves Tier-1/Tier-2 retailers across five continents.

| Attribute | Details |
|---|---|

| **Chat Widget** | Not confirmed |
| **Incentives** | Free access to vetted audit form library; no-contract trial |

**Key Takeaway:** The most product-led approach in the competitive set. Self-serve signup, no credit card, transparent starting price, and instant access to pre-built templates. This is the model closest to modern PLG best practices.

### 6. Repsly

Retail execution platform for field teams. Pay-per-user subscription with volume tiers.

| Attribute | Details |
|---|---|
| **Free Trial** | Conflicting info. Official pricing page: no traditional trial; offers POC during sales process |
| **Trial Length** | Custom POC |
| **Signup Flow** | Sales-assisted. Business email required for product tour access |
| **Credit Card Required** | Not for POC |
| **Product Tour / Interactive Demo** | **Yes** -- web-based tour at repsly.com/product-tour (desktop only, email-gated) |

| **Pricing Visibility** | Hidden. Custom. Starts ~$29/user/month with volume discounts |
| **Chat Widget** | Not confirmed |
| **Incentives** | None publicly visible |

**Key Takeaway:** Gates product tour behind email capture (smart for lead gen). Desktop-only tour is a limitation for their field-team audience.

## SaaS Onboarding Best Practices

### Trial Length: What Converts Best?

Based on 2025 benchmarks across 10,000+ SaaS companies:

| Trial Length | Conversion Rate | Best For |
|---|---|---|
| **7 days** | ~40.4% | Simple products with fast time-to-value |
| **14 days** | Industry standard (42% of companies) | Most SaaS products; balances urgency with evaluation |
| **30+ days** | ~30.6% | Complex enterprise tools needing internal approval |

7-14 day trials with urgency cues outperform 30-day trials by 71%.

**StoreScore recommendation:** **14-day trial.** Users need time to set up a template, conduct at least one walk, and review reports. 14 days is sufficient while maintaining urgency.

### Credit Card: Required or Not?

| Approach | Trial Signup Rate | Trial-to-Paid Rate | Net Paying Customers |
|---|---|---|---|
| **No credit card (opt-in)** | 8.5% of visitors | 18-25% | **+27% more total** |
| **Credit card required (opt-out)** | 2.5% of visitors | 49-60% | Lower total |

**StoreScore recommendation:** **No credit card required.** For a newer brand, removing friction generates 3-4x more trial starts and 27% more paying customers from the same traffic.

### Self-Serve vs. Sales-Assisted

For B2B SaaS at $50-500/month, data supports a **hybrid model:**

- **Product-led entry:** Self-serve trial for individual contributors and small operators (1-10 locations)
- **Sales-assisted expansion:** For 10+ locations, enterprise features, custom integrations. PQLs from trial usage convert 5-10x faster than MQLs
- 91% of B2B SaaS companies are investing more in PLG

### Interactive Demos

- 18% of B2B SaaS websites now have interactive demo CTAs (up 40% YoY)
- Top demos achieve 84.4% engagement rate
- Companies see 15% more MQLs, 2-week shorter sales cycles, PQLs that convert 5-8x better

### Chat Widgets

- For PLG companies at StoreScore's stage, Intercom (~$39/seat/month) is the right tier
- Chat serves dual purpose: pre-sale conversion and post-trial onboarding support

### Activation & Time-to-Value

- Every extra minute to first value lowers conversion by 3%
- Target: first meaningful value in under 10 minutes
- 3-5 step onboarding checklists are the sweet spot
- Every extra signup form field costs ~7% conversion
- Contextual feature introduction yields 3x higher conversion vs. traditional onboarding

## Actionable Recommendations for StoreScore

### Priority 1: Launch Self-Serve Free Trial (High Impact)

Only Bindy offers this. This is StoreScore's biggest differentiation opportunity.

- **14-day free trial**, no credit card required
- Signup: name, email, company name, number of locations (4 fields max)
- Email verification, then straight into the product
- Pre-populate account with sample store and starter audit template
- Onboarding checklist (3-5 steps): (1) Customize first template, (2) Add a store, (3) Complete first walk, (4) View score report, (5) Invite a team member

**Expected:** ~8.5% visitor-to-trial conversion, ~18-25% trial-to-paid conversion.

### Priority 2: Build Interactive Product Tour (High Impact)

Only GoSpotCheck/FORM and Repsly have this. Proven to shorten sales cycles by 2 weeks.

- Use Navattic, Storylane, or Arcade for clickthrough demo
- Show core loop: create template -> walk store -> see scores -> view analytics
- Gate behind email capture for lead generation
- Place as secondary CTA: "See It in Action"
- Ensure mobile + desktop support

### Priority 3: Make Pricing Transparent (Medium Impact)

Only Jolt and Bindy show any pricing.

- 2-3 visible tiers (Starter, Professional, Enterprise)
- Per-location or per-user pricing that scales predictably
- "Contact Sales" for Enterprise to capture larger accounts
- Show free trial prominently on pricing page

### Priority 4: Add Chat Widget (Medium Impact)

None of the competitors appear to have this on marketing sites.

- Use Intercom, Crisp, or Tidio
- Automated greetings for marketing pages and trial users
- Route to human during business hours; AI/canned after hours

### Priority 5: Pre-Built Templates as Lead Magnet (Medium Impact)

- Public "Template Library" page with 10-15 industry-standard audit templates
- Preview structure without signup; require signup to use/customize
- Doubles as SEO content for "store audit checklist" searches

### Priority 6: Trial Nurture Email Sequences (Lower Immediate Impact)

- Day 0: Welcome + "Complete first walk in 10 minutes"
- Day 1: Feature highlight
- Day 3: Behavior-based check-in
- Day 7: Mid-trial usage summary
- Day 10: "4 days left" urgency
- Day 13: "Last day" conversion CTA
- Day 14+: "We miss you" + discount/extension offer

### Priority 7: Hybrid PLG + Sales Motion (Strategic)

- **Self-serve:** Tour -> Trial -> Self-serve checkout (plans under $200/month)
- **Sales-assisted:** Tour -> Trial -> PQL triggers (3+ users, 5+ walks) -> Sales outreach
- **Enterprise:** "Contact Sales" -> Custom demo -> Pilot -> Contract
- Track self-serve vs. sales-assisted revenue separately from Day 1

## Competitive Positioning Summary

| Competitive Gap | StoreScore Opportunity |
|---|---|
| Most competitors require demo calls | **Self-serve 14-day trial** |
| Only 2 of 7 have interactive demos | **Interactive product tour** |
| Only 2 of 7 show pricing | **Transparent pricing tiers** |
| None have visible chat widgets | **Live chat on marketing site** |
| Only 1 offers pre-built templates at signup | **Template library as lead magnet** |
| Most have opaque onboarding | **"First walk in 10 minutes" guided onboarding** |

By combining self-serve trial, interactive demo, transparent pricing, and guided onboarding, StoreScore can offer the most accessible entry point in the competitive set while still supporting sales-assisted paths for larger accounts.
