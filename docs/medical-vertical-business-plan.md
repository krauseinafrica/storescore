# CareScore — Medical Facility Quality Management Platform

**Business Plan & Pitch Document**
**Date:** February 2026
**Parent Platform:** StoreScore (shared infrastructure, white-labeled for medical)

---

## Executive Summary

CareScore is a white-labeled vertical of the StoreScore platform, purpose-built for multi-location medical practices, surgical centers, and healthcare groups. It enables practice owners and administrators to conduct standardized facility inspections across all locations — ensuring consistent patient experience, regulatory readiness, and operational excellence.

The platform leverages the same proven infrastructure powering StoreScore (AI photo analysis, gamification, scheduling, action items) but with terminology, templates, scoring criteria, and workflows adapted specifically for healthcare facilities.

**Target customer:** Multi-location medical/surgical practices with 3-50+ offices (ophthalmology, optometry, dental, dermatology, orthopedics, urgent care, veterinary).

## The Problem

### Multi-Location Medical Practices Face Consistency Challenges

When a practice grows from 1 office to 5, 10, or 15+ locations, maintaining consistent quality becomes exponentially harder:

1. **Patient experience varies by location** — Waiting rooms, check-in areas, exam rooms, and retail spaces (optical, pharmacy) can drift in quality when the owner isn't physically present.

2. **Regulatory inspections are pass/fail surprises** — OSHA, state licensing boards, and accreditation bodies (AAAHC, Joint Commission) conduct inspections that practices can't fully prepare for without regular self-audits.

3. **No standardized inspection tool exists for medical** — Practices use paper checklists, spreadsheets, or nothing at all. Regional/office managers do "walk-throughs" but there's no scoring, no photos, no tracking, no accountability.

4. **Equipment and supply readiness is inconsistent** — Exam rooms may be missing supplies, equipment may need calibration, emergency supplies may be expired — and nobody catches it until a patient encounter or inspection.

5. **Staff adherence to protocols varies** — Signage, PPE availability, HIPAA safeguards (screen locks, document handling), and infection control practices drift without regular audits.

6. **No data to drive improvement** — Without scored evaluations, practice owners can't compare locations, identify trends, or hold office managers accountable with objective metrics.

### The Cost of Inconsistency

- **Failed regulatory inspections** → fines, remediation costs, potential closure
- **Negative patient reviews** → lost revenue ($200+ per lost patient lifetime value in ophthalmology)
- **Staff turnover** → poorly maintained facilities correlate with lower staff satisfaction
- **Malpractice risk** → equipment and safety deficiencies increase liability exposure
- **Owner stress** → feeling compelled to personally visit every location regularly

## The Solution: CareScore

### What It Does

CareScore provides a structured, scored facility inspection system for multi-location medical practices:

1. **Facility Walks** — Standardized inspections of each office covering waiting room, check-in, exam rooms, procedure rooms, optical/retail, restrooms, exterior, and back-office areas.

2. **AI Photo Analysis** — Snap photos during a walk and AI evaluates facility conditions, identifying issues like cluttered waiting areas, expired signage, missing PPE, disorganized supply rooms, or equipment concerns.

3. **Scoring & Benchmarking** — Each location receives a score. Compare offices against each other, track trends over time, and identify which locations need attention.

4. **Action Items & Follow-ups** — Low-scoring areas automatically generate action items assigned to office managers with due dates, priority levels, and photo-verified resolution.

5. **Compliance Templates** — Pre-built inspection templates for:
   - OSHA workplace safety
   - HIPAA physical safeguards
   - State licensing requirements
   - Accreditation readiness (AAAHC, Joint Commission)
   - General facility quality
   - Equipment & supply readiness

6. **Scheduling & Automation** — Schedule monthly, quarterly, or custom-cadence inspections. Automatic reminders to office managers. Calendar integration.

7. **Gamification** — Office leaderboards, achievement badges (e.g., "Perfect Score," "Consistent Performer," "Rapid Resolver"), and improvement tracking to drive healthy competition between locations.

8. **Self-Assessments** — Office managers complete self-assessments between formal walks, building accountability and catching issues early.

## ROI Analysis

### For a 10-Location Eye Care Practice

**Current cost of NOT having CareScore:**

| Issue | Annual Cost |
|---|---|
| 1 failed OSHA inspection (avg fine) | $3,000–$15,000 |
| 2 negative Google reviews mentioning facility ("dirty," "outdated") | ~$10,000 in lost patient LTV |
| Owner/admin travel time for in-person walkthroughs (10 locations × 12 visits × 4 hours including travel) | 480 hours/year (~$24,000 at $50/hr loaded) |
| 1 equipment issue caught late (patient rescheduled, liability) | $500–$5,000 |
| Staff turnover partially attributed to facility frustration (1 extra turnover/year) | $3,000–$8,000 |
| **Total estimated annual cost** | **$40,000–$62,000** |

**CareScore investment:**
- 10 locations × $49/month = $5,916/year

**ROI: 7-10x return on investment**

### Key Value Propositions for the Pitch

1. **"You can't be in 10 places at once."** — CareScore gives you eyes in every office, every week, without driving there.

2. **"Prepare for inspections, don't react to them."** — Regular self-audits mean you're always inspection-ready. No surprises from OSHA, state boards, or accreditation visits.

3. **"Your patients notice what you don't."** — Dirty waiting rooms, outdated signage, and disorganized optical displays cost you patients and Google stars. CareScore catches it before patients do.

4. **"Hold office managers accountable with data."** — No more subjective "the office looks fine." Scored inspections with photos create objective accountability.

5. **"AI catches what humans miss."** — Photo analysis identifies issues that even trained evaluators overlook — expired signage, missing supplies, equipment concerns.

## Competitive Landscape for Medical Facility Inspections

### Current Tools Medical Practices Use
1. **Paper checklists** — Most common. No scoring, no photos, no tracking, no accountability.
2. **Spreadsheets** — Some practices use Excel/Google Sheets. Better than paper but no mobile, no photos, no AI.
3. **Accreditation software** (Compliancy Group, MedTrainer) — Focused on HIPAA/OSHA *documentation*, not physical facility inspections.
4. **General audit tools** (SafetyCulture/iAuditor) — Not medical-specific. No healthcare templates. Intimidating setup for medical staff.
5. **Nothing** — Many practices simply don't inspect systematically until a regulatory body forces them to.

### CareScore's Advantages Over Existing Options
- **Medical-specific templates** — Pre-built for ophthalmology, optometry, dental, etc.
- **AI photo analysis** — No other medical facility tool offers this
- **Gamification** — Healthy competition between offices is unique in healthcare
- **Purpose-built for multi-location** — Not adapted from construction safety or restaurant compliance
- **Affordable** — Under $50/office/month vs. $0 (paper) means the value has to be obvious

## Pitch Script for Eye Care Friend

> "Hey [Name], I've been building a platform called StoreScore that helps multi-location businesses do quality inspections across their locations — scored facility walks with photos, AI analysis, action items, the whole thing. We're using it with hardware stores right now.
>
> I realized the exact same system would be incredibly valuable for a practice like yours with [X] offices. Think about it — how do you currently know that the waiting room in [Location A] looks as good as [Location B]? That every exam room has the right supplies? That your optical displays are merchandised consistently?
>
> Most practices either don't inspect systematically, or they do paper checklists that nobody follows up on. This platform gives you scored inspections with photos, AI that analyzes facility conditions, automatic action items assigned to office managers, and a dashboard comparing all your locations.
>
> I put together a demo page so you can see what it would look like for a medical practice. Take a look and let me know if this is something that would be useful — I'd love to pilot it with your group for free for 90 days."
