## Tier 1: Hot Prospects

These are businesses with 3-15 locations that are an ideal fit for StoreScore's scored facility quality inspections, AI photo analysis, action items, and gamification features. They are locally owned/operated and likely have decision-makers accessible in the region.

### Hardware / Home Improvement

#### Northwest Ace Hardware
- **Locations:** 12 stores across Virginia and North Carolina
- **Key Locations:** 3 stores in Roanoke, 1 in Blacksburg, plus locations in Salem, Christiansburg, and surrounding areas
- **Headquarters:** Roanoke, Virginia
- **Website:** [northwesthardware.com](https://www.northwesthardware.com/)
- **Why they're a good fit:** Locally owned since 1947 with 12 locations -- the sweet spot for StoreScore. Hardware stores have complex merchandising standards (seasonal displays, endcaps, tool walls, paint departments) that benefit from scored inspections with photo documentation. Each store must maintain Ace Hardware brand standards while being independently operated. Multi-department layout (plumbing, electrical, tools, paint, outdoor) creates natural scoring categories.
- **Tier:** HOT

#### Capps Home Building Center
- **Locations:** 3 stores in Virginia (Roanoke showroom, Smith Mountain Lake store/showroom, Troutville building supply)
- **Headquarters:** Moneta, Virginia (Smith Mountain Lake area)
- **Website:** [shopcapps.com](https://www.shopcapps.com/)
- **Why they're a good fit:** Growing local building supply chain with 3 locations serving different customer segments (retail showroom, contractor supply, lakeside). Design showrooms require high visual merchandising standards. Recently expanded to Troutville, indicating growth trajectory. Facility quality directly impacts customer confidence in premium building products.
- **Tier:** HOT

### Restaurant Chains (Local/Regional)

- **Headquarters:** Roanoke, Virginia (founded 1978)
- **Website:** [macados.net](https://www.macados.net/)
- **Why they're a good fit:** Classic StoreScore target -- a regional restaurant chain founded in Roanoke with 16 locations spread across 4 states. Restaurants have intensive facility quality needs (kitchen cleanliness, dining area presentation, restroom standards, exterior curb appeal). Multi-state footprint makes consistent quality inspections critical. Roanoke HQ means direct access to ownership/operations leadership. Their eclectic decor and themed interiors create unique inspection requirements per location.
- **Tier:** HOT

#### Benny's Pizza
- **Locations:** ~35 locations across Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wyoming
- **Key SW Virginia Locations:** 2 in Blacksburg, 1 in Roanoke (Benny Marconi's downtown)
- **Headquarters:** Blacksburg, Virginia (founded 2011)
- **Website:** [bennysva.com](https://www.bennysva.com/)
- **Why they're a good fit:** Fast-growing pizza chain that expanded from 1 to 35 locations in ~15 years. Rapid growth across multiple states creates urgent need for standardized quality inspections. Quick-service format means high throughput and wear-and-tear on facilities. Multiple brand concepts (Benny Marzano's, Benny Marconi's, Benny Adelina's) add complexity to standards management. Virginia Tech connection provides young, tech-forward culture receptive to digital tools.
- **Tier:** HOT

#### Mill Mountain Coffee & Tea
- **Locations:** 6 stores across Virginia

- **Tier:** HOT

#### Little Green Hive
- **Locations:** 3 locations in Virginia
- **Key Locations:** Downtown Roanoke, Grandin Village (Roanoke), Daleville Town Center
- **Headquarters:** Roanoke, Virginia
- **Why they're a good fit:** Woman-owned, family-operated local chain with 3 locations. Growing brand in the Roanoke market. Health/wellness-focused food concept requires strict cleanliness and presentation standards. Small enough that ownership is directly involved in operations decisions.

- **Tier:** WARM (larger chain, but Virginia-headquartered with perfect vertical fit)

---

- **Tier:** WARM (30 properties is larger, but the vertical fit is excellent)

---

- **Website:** [becpas.com](https://becpas.com/)
- **Why they're a good fit:** 12-office professional services firm.
