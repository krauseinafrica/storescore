## Target Industries — Ranked by Opportunity

### TIER 1: Highest Opportunity (Attack First)

#### 1. Quick-Service Restaurants / Franchise Restaurants
**Opportunity: 9.5/10** | **Market: 200,000+ QSR outlets, ~$447B market**

**Why they need StoreScore:**
- Brand standards drift across franchise locations (food presentation, cleanliness, signage)
- Food safety compliance documentation — photo evidence with EXIF freshness validation proves inspections happened
- Slow corrective action loops (paper → days of delay; StoreScore → hours)
- Franchise owner visibility into compliance across locations
- 96% of QSR operators plan to open new locations in next 12-18 months

**StoreScore advantages over incumbents (Zenput/Crunchtime, FORM):**
- AI photo analysis for food prep area verification (no manual scoring bias)
- Self-assessments let store managers do daily photo checks without a visiting auditor
- Photo freshness validation prevents gaming/backdating
- 1/10th the cost of enterprise tools like Crunchtime

**Ideal early adopters:**
- Mid-size franchise groups: 10-100 locations (regional Subway, Wendy's, Chick-fil-A franchisees)
- Emerging QSR brands actively expanding
- Pizza/delivery chains needing kitchen + front-of-house audits

**Templates to build:**
- Kitchen / Food Prep
- Front of House / Dining Area
- Drive-Through
- Restrooms
- Exterior / Parking Lot

---

#### 2. Grocery / Supermarkets
**Opportunity: 9.0/10** | **Market: 40,000 supermarkets + 63,000 grocery stores in US**

**Why they need StoreScore:**
- 8-15 distinct departments per store (produce, deli, bakery, meat, dairy, frozen, pharmacy, floral) — **StoreScore's department system is a perfect architectural fit**
- Perishable merchandising compliance (AI photo analysis of produce displays, deli cases)
- Regional managers spend 2+ hours per store on paper audits; digital cuts to 20 minutes
- Strict food safety regulations (OSHA, health department, FDA)

**StoreScore advantages:**
- Department-level evaluations with weighted scoring — built for this exact use case
- DepartmentType catalog can be pre-populated with grocery departments
- SOP document management with AI-suggested criterion links maps health department requirements

**Ideal early adopters:**
- Regional grocery chains: 15-75 stores (Stater Bros, Raley's scale)
- Natural/organic specialty grocers (Sprouts, Fresh Thyme) with high presentation standards
- Cooperative groceries with shared governance needing standardized audits

**Department types to build:**
- Produce
- Deli / Prepared Foods
- Bakery
- Meat / Seafood
- Dairy / Frozen
- Pharmacy
- Floral
- Front End / Checkout

---

#### 3. Convenience Stores / Gas Stations
**Opportunity: 8.5/10** | **Market: 150,000+ c-stores in US**

**Why they need StoreScore:**
- Lean staff (1-3 per shift) — no dedicated audit manager; self-assessments are the answer
- Fuel island + exterior compliance is visual → AI photo analysis excels here
- High turnover makes SOPs critical for new employee standards
- Branded stations (Shell, BP, Chevron) require brand image compliance documentation

**StoreScore advantages:**
- Self-assessment with AI review — shift lead takes photos, AI provides objective scoring
- Photo freshness validation prevents reusing old photos
- SOP links surface relevant procedures during evaluations

**Ideal early adopters:**
- Multi-site c-store operators: 10-50 locations
- Branded fuel franchisees needing compliance documentation

**Templates to build:**
- Interior Store Condition
- Fuel Island / Exterior
- Food Service Area
- Restrooms
- Cash Handling / Security

---

### TIER 2: Strong Opportunity (Phase 2)

#### 4. Hotels / Hospitality
**Opportunity: 8.0/10** | **Market: 55,000+ hotels in US**

**Why they need StoreScore:**
- Multi-department complexity (housekeeping, front desk, F&B, engineering, spa, pool)
- Brand standard verification for management companies operating under multiple flags
- Housekeeping photo verification with AI analysis
- Guest-facing vs. back-of-house weighting

**Ideal early adopters:** Hotel management companies managing 10-40 select-service properties

**Department types to build:**
- Housekeeping
- Front Desk / Lobby
- Food & Beverage
- Engineering / Maintenance
- Pool / Fitness
- Exterior / Grounds

---

#### 5. Apparel / Fashion Retail
**Opportunity: 7.5/10** | **Less than 40% of visual merchandising displays executed properly**

**Why they need StoreScore:**
- Visual merchandising execution gap — HQ designs, stores execute poorly
- Seasonal changeover compliance (frequent resets need scheduled audits)
- AI photo analysis comparing submitted photos against display standards

**Ideal early adopters:** Mid-tier specialty retail chains: 20-100 stores (Torrid, Hot Topic-scale)

---

#### 6. Pharmacy / Healthcare Retail
**Opportunity: 7.0/10** | **25,000+ pharmacy audits conducted annually by major auditors**

**Why they need StoreScore:**
- Regulatory documentation burden (controlled substances, temperature monitoring)
- Multi-location compliance tracking with scoring drivers identifying systemic issues
- High regulatory complexity = high willingness to pay

**Ideal early adopters:** Independent pharmacy chains: 5-30 locations, compounding pharmacy networks

---

#### 7. Automotive Dealerships
**Opportunity: 7.0/10** | **40 of top 50 dealer groups use compliance software**

**Why they need StoreScore:**
- OEM brand standard compliance (manufacturer audits of facilities)
- Service department quality via photo-based evaluations
- Multi-rooftop dealer groups need centralized visibility

**Ideal early adopters:** Mid-size dealer groups: 5-15 rooftops preparing for OEM audits
