Amish looks much better and grass as well. Continue to kill weeds in the islands and clean up but the mulch is a safety hazard.	 3	4	4	5	4	1	Entry has closeout items where the knife table needs to go: have it ready for Tom by Wednesday. Floor stacks are too tall and limit visibly from the register as well as a customer’s visibility to the power aisle. Customer Bathrooms MUST BE CLEANED TWICE PER WEEK! No exceptions. Refer to the bathroom cleaning checklist for areas that need attention.	 1	1	3	1	4	5	Plumbing, electrical, tools, and Hardware need to have their dead peg hooks pulls and areas tightened up and merchandised.	Old tags in electrical from 2019 need to be updated as well as plumbing (toilet repair, stems, thin wall PVC). Hundreds of outs but new PIP process should help address that. Goal is from Truck to Floor in 24 hours so all stock in the back room that is not on the floor needs to be worked out (grills, stihl, seasonal, and  bulk goods are all that should be stocked in receiving).	 3	2	1	4	Warehouse is better than last time but it still needs attention. Order was stocked in 24 hours but there are still orders from May that need to be worked up onto the sales floor. Fire lane has merchandise in the aisle. Trash cans are empty but there are loads of trash that still need to be disposed of. Every week, walk through your warehouse With your employees and work out merchandise.	 3	4	Totes and boxes in the floor on bolt aisle. Glass leaning against pallet rack on sales floor, carts with merchandise on it and more totes in floor on mailbox aisle.	Lots of areas that can be improved upon. While your up front area and decor is very good, it’s time to focus our efforts into running a successful retail hardware store now.  We need to address all of the issues and attempt to correct them as quickly as possible to prepare for Black Friday and Christmas open house.

Slides on the sign are good and have been updated recently.	 4	3	3	4	4	5	Entry looks good when entering. Unlike the wind chimes in the vestibule but they might be better where they can be shopped.  Christmas display looks good in front but we still need to address the impulse area.  Moving Hallmark and Grills currently but it’s coming along; keep rolling with this as a priority until it’s done. Checkout area is clear and knife table looks awesome. Helpful hub is currently a mess because of the move with Hallmark. Paint desk is a little messy. Try cleaning  up all the paint stacked in the floor near the bathrooms or adding some shelving. Bathrooms were spotless.	 3	2	2	4	4	5	Lots of shelf maintenance needed. Every aisle has a least one 4’ peg section seems to have items several items either without homes or in the wrong place. Locations, closeout items, double tags, and regular maintenance can be addressed more easily by utilizing the PIP process that we have gone over.	 Need to shoot outs in the whole store at least once per week to address the outs, closeout tags, and shelf maintenance issues. Basedeck and old price tags need to be cleaned and cleared.	2	5	5	5	Warehouse is in danger of falling back into disorganization. Constant vigilance and working out all new products as soon as possible will help alleviate the constraints of a small back room. Good job getting your order from truck to floor in 24 hours.	2	5	Lots of totes and carts in the aisles because of the Hallmark move (most of which I am responsible for). Make it a priority to finish this move and don’t let it linger. The majority will be done this week but the details and fine tuning need to be finalized as soon as possible.	Store is coming along nicely. Keep working towards the goal of having only backstock, seasonal, Yeti and Stihl in the back room.							 11/10/2022	nwace.regional@gmail.com		2022 Christiansburg

Maybe consider moving the furniture away from the corn.	 3	5	5	5	4	4	Entry is very cluttered. Feels like you have to walk in a tunnel. The floor displays are overwhelming and the Christmas decorations are a little hard to shop as a result of the narrow walk way small landing area.  I don’t have a great fix for this but the entry needs to be adjusted somehow. Checkout area, paint mixing and floors all look great.

Let's follow up with him asap.	5	5	4	4	5	4	The store looks great! Very welcoming and tidy.  The paint mixing area needs a little buttoning up.  The bathrooms are fine, but we had a paper towel discpenser on the shelf in the womens room, and we should remove the old one in the mens room and put the new one in its place.	5	5	5	5	5	5	All good here, the only worry I have going forward is staying on backstock when its not in sight (warehouse).	Keep checking outs and listening to customers on what we need to add to our selection.	3	5	5	4	The trash is something we can't magically correct but once its sqaured away we will be good to go for the future.

Lots happening but not a lot that makes sense	Improved over last month. Continue to work on shelf maintenance and shooting outs in PIP. This will help with claims if nothing else. Keep hammering on old yellow tags and locations as well.	3	5	4	4	Continues to be an issue. Every week your staff should be trying to work out more and more product and get it out of the floor to make space, keep it clean, and reduce shrink from rodents.  Good work getting your orders up, but remember truck to floor in 24.	4	5	Much improved here as well. Light bulb tote in the aisle but a big improvement overall.

Good job!	5	5	5	4	3	5	Garden flags, grills, and willowtree	Store has less outs than I have seen in months. Stihl rack was even full.  Pricing and locations were accurate. Garden flags and floor mats are a mess and need to be cleaned up and hung back up.  Grills are also a little crazy and could use a good dusting, but not too bad. There are several willow tree figurines that need to be worked up in the back room.	3	5	5	5	Definitely seen worse, but I’ve also seen it better. Be careful not to fall into a trap here and back slide.

Too much temptation for customers to steal them. Need some palllet goods but was told they are on transfer.	 4	5	3	3	4	4	Entry looks great. Grills setup and clean. Checkout looks clean and uncluttered. Paint desk/hub is very messy with cats and totes in the floor. Hallmark looks bare and the two empty displays need to be taken off the sales floor or filled up. Bathrooms are clean but the floors needs to be cleaned more thoroughly.	5	4	5	5	5	3	Endcaps. Stihl. Hallmark	Price tags and locations look good. All Ace sourced product seems to be in good stock and not overstocked. It seems we are struggling with third party products like Stihl and Hallmark. Lots of outs in Stihl. Check with Williamson to get filled.  Only 1 endcap header displayed. Need to rework some endcaps. No roving on WQ seed for instance.	 4	5	5	5	Still looking good. A little mess, but nothing crazy.	 4	5	Avoid setting totes on the floor and working out of them; possible trip hazard. Dispose of any wooden ladder in the store.	Overall good store walk.

Pallet of firewood still bundled and strapped needs to be available to be sold. Dispose of old bags of Quickrete Sandmix and do not reorder.	 4	4	4	4	4	4	Entry looks great. Truly a big difference. Stihl is full, merchandising looks good. Recommend moving the Yeti off the floor as much as possible except for the 2 racks to increase visibility.

Great work keeping this area productive and good job getting your orders up. Again, goal is “Truck to floor in 24”.	 5	5	Good work here folks.	 Good evaluation overall. Still a few areas we can improve on with regards to shelf maintenance.  Remember that we must shoot outs in PIP every, single, week, and review them for claims, stock-outs, etc. I will be checking your date if last PIP every Monday.

Cigarette butt container by the back door is full of butts and water, looks rough. The back lot and hill still need to be seeded.	3	4	4	4	4	5	Need to strap down and get to work on the impulse section. Front registers have a lot of out of date product: close out and policy a. Entry looks good but I think we need more product pricing on the Stihl big units; floors could use a little cleaning in spots like where the paint mixer is and I’m front of the hub. Bathrooms were good	3	2	4	4	4	4	Lawn and garden; long handled tools; grass seed; automotive	 Lots of double tags and shelf maintenance issues. We are not shooting outs nearly enough and it shows; clicked over 350 outs in 1/4 of the store. Must do better here.	4	5	3	5	We still have the cleaning reset that was delivered 4 weeks ago. This needs to be finished ASAP. Back room otherwise if manageable.	 5	5		Store has a lot going right but the shelf maintenance issues, outs, double tags, and location issues are snowballing on you guys.

Pricing on the pallets out front is alway an issue, is there a better way? Your electronic reader board does not need to have our winter hours on it, but even so, they are wrong. We are not closed on Saturday as it insinuates. That reader board is the best way to interact with your customers daily and it isn’t being utilized effectively.	 5	5	4	5	5	3	Your entry and first look are very good. Registers are clear of clutter and well stocked in impulse. Paint desk is good and lower hub is effective. Your main bathroom needs some serious work. The toilet is cracked around the flange, there was water and toilet paper on the floor, the floors themselves look dirty and gross and the bathroom door is very hard to operate.	 5	2	3	4	5	5	Tools, PTA, Stihl,	 Over triple the amount of outs I expected to see in your power tools and accessories as well as Stihl bars and Chains. Over 300 outs in an area that 100 would be considered acceptable. Location and closeout maintenance is a big reason but another is the shooting of outs that is too sporadic. Try and get his done religiously.	 3	5	5	4	Your Stihl parts and workshop are in serious need of organizing before the season really breaks loose. Currently assembling units would be a struggle.	5	5	Keep it ip	The store looks great on the surface and most of your areas where we’ve applied focus like grills, lawn and garden, flags, and hallmark have really been highlighted and show great. Now it’s time to put our focus back into the moves and flow that we need to have happen to accomplish your sales goal for 2023. You may consider assigning some of your new people to these departments to give them an opportunity to learn and advance with your guidance.  Before you move tools or Accessories, we have to make sure all those empty tags are valid and part of the set so that needs to be a priority.							 2/14/2023	nwAce.regional@gmail.com		2023 Vinton

Pricing and pallet goods  need updating and need to be rotated when new stock comes in, but everything else looks good.	5	5	4	3	4	2	Entry looks great, clean, inviting, and relevant. Checkout the same, along with the power aisle. Paint desk looks good but the floor around the mixer is a mess. Helpful bug is good but a little cluttered. Bathrooms are bad. Looks like they haven’t been cleaned since the last time I was here. Get this fixed.	4	3	3	4	4	5	Deadwood on every aisle; flags and fishing tackle.	Scanning outs every week has definitely helped with your shelf maintenance but you have thousands of dead peg hooks that need to be pulled now and those sections reset one by one. Start in Lawn and Garden once it’s finished move to paint, then housewares, and finally plumbing and hardware. Electrical looks much better now that is been reset and all the dead hooks removed.	 3	5	5	5	Continues to be a warehouse and not a junk-house which is acceptable. Keep working towards the goal minimizing what we have in the warehouse. Try to move as much of the backstock that we keep here to the shelf (where all the empty pegs are perhaps?)	5	5	Great work. Keep it up.	I feel like we’ve turned the corner. Keep working on the fundamentals of merchandising and customer service and the sales will come.

Diara is working to clean up tools and get merchandise off of the walls where it doesn’t get much traffic and on to the aisles where it is near like items. Continue this practice and let’s get as much relevant products onto peg board as we can.	 2	4	4	4	Lots of Stihl laying in the fire lane (repaired units?) and things that are not on shelves or sales floor (Big Green Egg). Work bench is mess. Open container of gas, open boxes of product. Have to get a plan together for Stihl Repairs.	 5	5	Store safety is good but keep awareness with new employees of what is and is not acceptable safety protocols.	 Store looks good but we have a major issue in the back with stihl repairs and stock laying around. Have to stay vigilant in the back room or it will snowball into a disaster.							 6/12/2023	nwace.regional@gmail.com

Probably should pull plastic wrap off of pallets that are being used for stock (open salt, mulch, solid etc.) Sign should have pool water testing or propane but otherwise is good.	 4	5	5	5	3	4	Entry is good other than there feels like a choke point at the carts. Registers are nice and clean as well as the paint mixing/helpful hub area. Great work here. Bathrooms need the walls wiped down but otherwise are good.

Need more swedish torches	5	4	4	3	4	3	Store looks really good. Floors, up front, registers, all look great. The paint desk is good but the mixing area and shaker area around the floor looks pretty rough. Bathrooms need some work. Men’s toilet looks like it hasn’t been cleaned in a long time. But paper towels and soap are good.	4	4	4	4	4	5	Plumbing, hardware, automotive, endcaps	 Good in stock but we have a lot of holes from all the close outs. Gives the feeling we’re out of a lot of stuff when I’m reality we just have an excess of space. After inventory this month we need to get right and get tight.	 1	3	4	2	Warehouse is bad. Need to get his fixed this week in perpetration for inventory.	 3	5	Carts, ladders, and totes should not be in the aisle and you have all three. When not in use these need to be stored.	Your store is a story of two different priorities, the part the customers and the part they don’t, the part they see looks really good, and the part they don’t looks bad. The problem is that the part they don’t see causes your team to struggle to pull stock and help customers find product that we know is here. Still, all things considered, good job. Let’s have a good inventory.							 9/18/2023	nwace.regional@gmail.com		
1/18/2024 15:29:41	1/18/2024	Blackstone	1 2024	Blackstone 1 2024	4	5	5	4	5	Bagged goods and busted wood in the parking lot need to be thrown away in the roll off next week. Everything else is at or above standards.	5	5	5	5	5	5	Super clean. Great looking entry and floors. Bathrooms look like they were just cleaned today. Hub and Paint Desk are both clear and neat. Great work!	4	5	5	5	4	5	Sporting Goods; Knives; Big Green Egg Accessories/ Grills.	We have some old price tags and things that could use some “fresh” labels but everything is up to par otherwise. Working without functioning TC scanners I expected it to be much much worse. Only thing I would recommend is to move the Big Green Egg accessory boxes off the floor and don’t lean them up where they could fall and either damage something or someone. Sporting Goods looks good so far and just needs to be finished.	5	5	5	4	Great! Across the street just needs the dumpster next week and it will be better.	5	5	Wonderful!	Store looks good. Clearly y’all have been working hard to keep it relevant and merchandised. The only two things I would like to point out are that we should not have any ammo on the sales floor. Handgun and Rifle ammo is too easily stolen or rang incorrectly when it is not behind the counter and I take issue with that personally. The second is that I want you to utilize the hours you’re provided to the best you can and if your employees are not willing to work what we need, we might be forced to find more flexible employees.							1/18/2024	nwace.regional@gmail.com		
1/19/2024 14:51:42	1/19/2024	Hollins	1 2024	Hollins 1 2024	5	5	5	4	5	Outside looks good. The front overhang needs to be restocked but otherwise is good. Love the propane car port. Need to put a light in the propane station.	 4	5	4	4	3	5	Overall store looks pretty good. The carts in the impulse, while effective for selling, look terrible. I wish there was another way of moving products that was more aesthetically pleasing. Floors also look pretty rough. Need to get a quote on getting the floors maintenanced. Hub/ Paint still continue to be a catch all. Overall though, not bad.	5	3	4	4	5	1	Endcaps. Bare Pegs.	 Price tags are up to date. There are a lot of outs throughout the store, and when I check for close outs or discontinued I find that some of it has sold recently. I think we need to look at increasing Min OP in some areas to reflect one to show/one to go especially on items under $5 cost. There are no Endcaps set or displayed, and we need several Stihl units assembled from Backstock.	4	5	5	5	With the exceptions of product we can’t set yet because we’re waiting on the list (PTA accessories) the warehouse looks good.	 5	5	Meets the standard	Store is ready for 2024 and all it holds. We have a lot of sections from aisle 8-13 that need some serious attention; lots of bare peg board. Floors and digital sign need to be added to cap expense requests for 2024 budget.  Would also like to look at possibilities for expanding or moving Stihl to a more prominent and visible location all that would endtail in both labor and fixture expenses. Keep it going though! $20k up for the month is a great start.							1/19/2024	nwace.regional@gmail.com		
1/20/2024 13:05:36	1/20/2024	Ridgeway	1 2024	Ridgeway 1 2024	4	5	5	4	5	Parking lot meets the standard of what is acceptable. New lighting looks good and makes the store outside much brighter. The front near the door has some pretty old black oil sunflower seed underneath what looks like newer bags. We should rotate stock so that we sell the old bags first. If they’re sun faded we should rotate the faded bags to the top so that they sell first. Need pricing on the logs that are on the Swedish torch display. The side of the building facing the road could use some cleaning up. Otherwise, looks pretty good.	  5	4	4	4	5	4	Entry and front of the store looks great. We do need to make sure register 3 is functional and everything works there in the event we need it. Try to keep that area clean. Same goes for the paint station and the helpful hub. It’s an improvement over last year but these areas become clutter catchers very quickly. Bathrooms look good but I would like to have you request better flushing toilets for capital expenditures in your budget because it looks like they’re all leaking past the wax seal and the toilets are terrible to flush.	 3	5	5	4	5	5	Electrical, plumbing, and jeans/heaters	Store looks fantastic from an “in stock” perspective, but we have hundreds if not thousands of old, faded, and missing price tags and that is unacceptable. We also need to fill in some missing Stihl but that’s about it. Really, a big improvement. The jeans need to be on the same side of the shelf though. Move and transpose the merchandise next to one side of the jeans so that they can all be inline with each other.	 3	5	5	5	A little messy, but it’s working and functional. Just don’t let it get too far away from your grip or it will start to snowball on you and become a huge problem. Clean up a little bit more each week to keep from back sliding but remember that a clean back room doesn’t make us any money, but a dirty back room can lose us a bunch.	 5	5	Good work	Love the feel of this store right now. It’s obvious a lot of work and care has been placed into especially the right side of the store. Time to work on the left. Be sure to include anything you need in your cap expense request next month. Keep it rolling!							1/20/2024	nwace.regional@gmail.com

Needs lights in the bottom part of the parking lot and pricing on the pallet goods.	 5	5	4	4	5	5	Great job here. Even with the rain and snow your floors look good. Carpets need to be cleaned next time they do the floors. Hub has a lot going on and needs a little attention but everything else is good. Bathrooms were very clean.	4	3	4	4	5	5	Stihl, Chicken Feed, VP Fuel, Gas Lines	stihl has too many outs and needs chain backstock pulled. We also are missing a lot of chicken feed from the shelf (may need to increase orders in winter, less for animal to forage for) and we could also use VP off the pallet rack outside and fill the shelf. We have some big holes in Plumbing with fittings and tapes probably because it’s been so cold. Have to keep an eye on those sections.	5	5	5	5	Great job	5	5	Keep it up. Remember to use wet floor signs when raining or snowing outside	Store looks good. As we already talked about, we need to work our orders and increase some of our QTY on A-D items. We shouldn’t be cutting anything other than “X” items or SO/SC items. Holes in our sets are disappointments tomorrow customers. Other than that, keep up the good work.							 1/24/2024	nwace.regional@gmail.com		
9/1/2025 11:49:23	9/1/2025	Walkertown	9 2025	Walkertown 9 2025	5	5	5	3	5	Electronic sign is non existent. Bagged goods should have shrink wrap removed to signal to a customer it’s available to purchase. The pricing sign isn’t adequate to signal customers prices and everything outside should at least have SKUs.	 5	4	5	5	5	5	Store looks very clean. A few items in the floor of the Weber Grill Aisle. Register 3 needs to be cleaned off and ready for business. Paint mixing area and helpful hub look awesome!

Mums should be on plant rack and not on the ground where possible. Plastic should be removed off solid, mulch, and gravel if we’re selling from that pallet. Sends the wrong signal. Why are wood pellets out in the elements?	4	4	4	4	4	5	Store is mostly fine. All the rugs need to be vacuumed daily and have gotten so bad they need to be deep cleaned. Paint desk is very messy and the hub is a little product cluttered as well. Floors look good except for the carpet on the ramp and the rugs. Need to be cleaned and vacuumed daily.	 3	4	5	4	4	3	Stihl Endcap, Copper fittings, Impulse	Some pockets of price changes that need to be addressed. Too many endcaps in Plumbing are permanent or semi-permanent that need to be adjusted.	 4	5	5	5	Backroom is a little messy on tables but not bad. Carport and back lot are a different story. Needs some attention.	5	5	Looks good.	 Overall the store is a Solid “B” but we do need to address pricing, displays, and some issues with our outside storage and display.	 https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ClByCuu68IbtyYu6YoSxjEhcDh2BB6fB, https://drive.google.com/open?id=1bkYM6NsfZbZWIL_PevnVLYNgKDHTrqqn, https://drive.google.com/open?id=1E-JX79lUlsJbAOmXx5mYevD9xlvf5MTr	https://drive.google.com/open?id=1kZFhMf0E6GFIbaxGtK56zRVnw8mnD2SS, https://drive.google.com/open?id=1u3j1Qo7brNl_ralBaSVuUdXEpSEuJruk, https://drive.google.com/open?id=1zhQFXe0zDTAqGpkOh5IURRq6czqRRySt, https://drive.google.com/open?id=1eqmlM46koWVVDQxLxIfUtYDmHwhdSCIm	https://drive.google.com/open?id=1beDU5ZszMKD8a5cqFQ7fV2OknBW8FQl9, https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Z3Pdco97i8t7y4tdnqgAgDDUH_5sGcuj, https://drive.google.com/open?id=1-5SIvPnZvpVCvk3nr-MqYcFw_4tFYjmx, https://drive.google.com/open?id=1qp-lGKpBEvGaR1iIV7AnxfB3iDEKz2U0				9/15/2025	nwace.regional@gmail.com

Discount heavily (90% off) broken Amish furniture to get rid of it.  Beautiful slides on the digital sign.	4	5	4	4	3	5	Store looks good when you first walk in but then becomes very tight and difficult to navigate with all the floor displays choking the walkway. Register is clean and impulse is merchandised well. Floors are filthy and I’m going to contact S&S to get them scheduled ASAP. Bathrooms look nice but consider larger paper holders for the toilet tissue to keep customers from running out. Paint desk is messy with product.	 2	4	5	3	5	1	Galvanized Fittings, Stihl Line and Chain,	 Pricing has pockets that need to be addressed. Some Stihl and Grass Seed but mainly Plumbing. I believe we missed one or more price updates so let’s work on getting that corrected. Lots of outs and opportunity in Stihl. Possible that we just need to pull backstock but take a look as well to make sure we don’t run out. There are currently 0 endcap headers up.	 3	5	4	5	Warehouse is a bit of a mess. Hallmark is an issue and I will address this with Olivia. Ultimately we need these items to be in a PO so that our time spent checking in the order or PIP at the back door is reduced to allow for the product to make it to the shelf.	 5	5	Good work	We have a little work to do up front and in the back room but otherwise the look and feel of the store are good. Focus on price changes, Stihl, and Hallmark products and let’s get ready for a solid 4th quarter!							9/15/2025	nwace.regional@gmail.com

The Stihl electronic sign is not wired so we need to get that done. Everything else looks good.	 4	5	5	5	4	5	Store is very clean with the exception of the floors and rugs. Make sure we vacuum these rugs daily and we may need to wash the rubber at least weekly.

We know why but we need to correct it ASAP. In addition we’re still finding pockets of SKUs in our set that say NOP25 but are indeed discovery. While it’s not a fault of the store per se, we need it corrected to help with in stock percentages.	 4	5	5	5	Side warehouse is good but we need some work in the back warehouse. Everything is good but we can do a little better.	 5	5	Good job!	Overall very good. Pricing and in stock seems to still be a struggle, but take it with a grain because everything else is phenomenal and double digit sales increases don’t happen on accident.							9/18/2025	nwace.regional@gmail.com
